this project in built and delivered through udacity workspace, 
I need to mention that working with this workspace is really hard to manage with but finally I finished it.



## API Reference

#### Get and resize any image that exist under images/full/ folder

you can resize an image by supplying the image name and your resolution:

```http
  GET /api/images?filename={imageName}&width={number}&height={number}
```


After the resize occurs, the generated image will be stored under images/thumbnails folder and you will be able to see it too.
